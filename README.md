# ALDA-Project# Neural-Network-Library
This is an MLP library (As of now), that has the following features:
a) 3 different optimization algorithms: Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, RMSProp 
b) Dropout, L2 regularization, L1 Regularization
c) Batch Normalization

Application: Used for detecting Number plates. The network is trained to recognize 36 alphanumeric characters. Each character in a Number plate is segmented and passed into the neural network for detection.
